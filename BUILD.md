# Release workflow to Publish a refreshed homebridge-apt-pkg

## High Level Workflow to Trigger a Release

1. Approve and merge Dependabot Pull Request ( triggers Stage 1 then 2 )
2. Wait about an hour for builds and validation to occur.
3. Change Prerelease to Release and set status as Latest ( triggers Stage 3 then 4 )

The package.json dependencies are used to manage the versions used within the release package.  And Dependabot watches the versions, and creates a pull request if a version needs updating.  Nothing else in package.json is used.  If you manually update the dependencies, package-lock.json also needs updating.

Then once a change is made to package.json in the latest branch, originated by Depandabot, the stage 1 workflow will kick off.

Release TAG is created by `reecetech/version-increment`, and is configured to increment the patch level every time, and not based on the package.json.  To release a minor or major release, the manual workflow dispatch must be used, and package.json/package-lock.json manually updated.

## Actions

### Stage 1 - Create a pre-release and build APT package
>Average Execution time: Approx 40 minutes

This job is triggered when package.json is updated on the latest branch, and the author of the change is dependabot.

1. Determine release version based on either manual workflow input or the latest release.
2. Build apt packages for x86_64, Arm ( RPI 32 bit), and aarch64 ( RPI 64 bit ).
3. Apt packages are stored as an artifact against the workflow.
4. Create a Pre-Release, and attach the artifacts.

### Stage 2 - Pre-Release Validation Workflow
>Average Execution time: Approx 5 minutes

This job is triggered by the the publishing of a prerelease or the completion of the stage 1 workflow..

1. This job checks that 3 apt packages are attached to the release ( x86_64, Arm ( RPI 32 bit), and aarch64 ( RPI 64 bit )).
2. That the homebridge_*_amd64.deb apt package can be installed, and that homebridge starts.

### Stage 3 - Promote Release Package to APT Stores
>Average Execution time: Approx 5 minutes

This job is triggered by the changing of the Release status from `pre-release` to `released`.  Changing the prerelease to release is a manual step.

1. Release assets are downloaded from the latest release
2. Assets are promoted to `repo.homebridge.io`
3. Cloud flare cache is purged

### Stage 4 - Post Release Validation
>Average Execution time: Approx 5 minutes

This job is triggered by the successful completion of step 3

1. Download the current homebridge-apt-pkg for x86 and install.
2. Check that homebridge starts
